# Shivani Chander
Hey there!
I'm **Shivani Chander** doing B.Tech in _Computer Science and Engineering_ at **NIT, Tiruchchirapalli**

Here's a bit about me:

1. I am a big fan of Logic because of which I chose this field of engineering.
2. My love for logic manifests in two forms
  * Convincing and proving my stand in a **debate** with a logical flow of arguments.
  * **Coding** algorithms and solutions to problems
3. I can **sing** carnatic music, **dance** bharatnatyam professionally and I hold a black belt in **_Karate_**
4. I share nerdy puns and memes on **Facebook**. So check out my profile [here](https://www.facebook.com/shivani.chander.94)
5. I've answered a handful of questions on **Quora** and would answer more in the days to come. Check it out [here](https://www.quora.com/profile/Shivani-Chander-1)

That's it for now, I guess! <3
